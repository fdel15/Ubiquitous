Technology developed at Brown University by [[John Donoghue]] to give people the ability to interact with computers/machines with their minds.

Described by [[Michi Kaku]] as the most sophisticated version of the technology and referenced an article about the technology that was published in Nature magazine in 2006.

A chip 4 millimeters wide is placed on top of a stroke victim's head where motor control occurs. The victim is able to progress from seeing a cursor on the screen, to controlling the cursor on the screen, to being able to play video games and write emails.

Patients can also control mobility by using their minds to control a motorized wheel chair.

[[Miguel A. L. Nicolelis]] is using chips in monkeys to allow them to control mechanical arms and legs
