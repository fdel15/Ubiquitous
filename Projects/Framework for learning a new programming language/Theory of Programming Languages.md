The theory of computer programming languages is the study of formal languages, grammars, and syntax used to describe the behavior of computer programs. It involves analyzing how computer programs are written and how they execute, with the goal of understanding their properties and developing new programming languages.

The theory of computer programming languages includes concepts such as syntax and semantics, type systems, program analysis, and optimization. It also covers topics such as programming language design and implementation, formal verification of programs, and the relationship between programming languages and the underlying hardware architecture.

One of the key goals of the theory of computer programming languages is to develop programming languages that are both expressive and safe. Expressiveness refers to a language's ability to express complex ideas and solutions in a concise and elegant way, while safety refers to the ability of a language to prevent certain types of programming errors and ensure program correctness.

Overall, the theory of computer programming languages is a rich and complex field that continues to evolve as new programming languages and technologies are developed.

Creating a programming language is a complex process that involves several key steps. Here is a brief overview of the typical process:

1.  Define the purpose and goals of the language: Before creating a programming language, it is important to have a clear idea of what the language will be used for and what specific features and capabilities it should have.
    
2.  Choose a language paradigm: The next step is to choose a programming paradigm for the language, such as object-oriented, functional, procedural, or declarative. The choice of paradigm will affect the syntax, structure, and semantics of the language.
    
3.  Design the syntax and grammar: Once the language paradigm has been chosen, the next step is to design the syntax and grammar of the language. This involves defining the rules for how the language will be structured and how programs will be written.
    
4.  Implement the language: After the syntax and grammar have been defined, the next step is to implement the language. This involves creating a compiler or interpreter that can translate the language into executable code.
    
5.  Test and refine the language: Once the language has been implemented, it is important to test it thoroughly and refine it based on feedback and user testing. This may involve making changes to the syntax, adding new features, or improving performance.
    
6.  Document the language: Finally, it is important to document the language, including its syntax, semantics, and features. This documentation should be clear and concise, and should help users understand how to use the language effectively.
    

Overall, creating a programming language is a complex process that requires careful planning, design, and testing. It requires a deep understanding of programming languages and computer science, as well as a creative and innovative approach to problem-solving.
