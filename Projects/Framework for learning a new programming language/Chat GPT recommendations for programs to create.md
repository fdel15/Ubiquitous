Prompt: What are some good programs to write when learning a new programming language

When learning a new programming language, it's important to write programs that cover a wide range of programming concepts and language features. Here are some examples of programs that can help you learn a new programming language:

1.  Hello World: A simple program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. This program can help you learn how to write and run basic code in the new language.
    
2.  Calculator: A program that takes two numbers as input and performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program can help you learn how to handle user input, perform calculations, and output the result.
    
3.  Guess the Number: A game that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. This program can help you learn how to use random numbers, conditionals, loops, and user input.
    
4.  Tic-Tac-Toe: A game that allows two players to take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 board. This program can help you learn how to use arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input.
    
5.  Hangman: A game where the user guesses letters to reveal a hidden word. This program can help you learn how to use strings, loops, conditionals, and user input.
    
6.  File Input/Output: A program that reads data from a file and performs some operations on it, such as filtering, sorting, or aggregating. This program can help you learn how to work with files, read and write data, and manipulate data structures.
    
7.  Web Scraper: A program that extracts data from a website by parsing its HTML code. This program can help you learn how to use regular expressions, string manipulation, and external libraries.
    
8.  Chatbot: A program that uses natural language processing to communicate with users and answer their questions. This program can help you learn how to use external libraries, handle complex data structures, and work with APIs.
