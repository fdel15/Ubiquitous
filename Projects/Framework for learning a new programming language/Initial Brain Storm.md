From [[2023-04-09]] daily note:

One other revelation that I am slowly starting to accept is that a fundamental skill I need to develop is learning a new programming language quickly.

This idea is in my head because I realized that I should port my version of poker_ai into C or Rust to make it as fast as possible.

I believe the best way to accomplish this goal is to set up a system for learning programming languages.

The system should involve the following steps:

- Get familiar with the syntax
- Read detailed book or documentation on the programming language's internals
- Complete a common/generic set of problems using the programming language

To get familiar with the syntax, I think it makes sense to solve LeetCode style problems with it. My process for solving this kind of algorithmic challenges is to solve the problem in English first, which will allow me to Google "how to do x" (such as for loop) in the programming language I am learning. I can then get fast feedback on "how to do x" or what I should do instead of "x" for the given language by testing to see if my solution works. As an added bonus, I will be practicing for future interviews.

A detailed book or documentation for the programming language will depend on which language I am learning. In Ruby it was beneficial to read **The Well Grounded Rubyist.** I will want to find something equivalent for other languages.

For a common set of generic problems to solve for each programming language I can finally make use of a resource I bought years ago. [Exercises For Progammers](https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding/dp/1680501224) has been sitting in my Kindle library for years, and the main thing that has stuck in my mind about this book is that the reason the author's wrote it was to have a consistent approach for learning a new programming language.

Ideally, I will be able to work through the three steps above in a month. Depending on how many algorithm problems I choose to solve and how many of the Exercises for Programmers I choose to solve, it could take two to three months to complete all of them.

I should create a curriculum with a list of algorithms and problems to solve to make it doable in a month, and a 2-3 month curriculum as well.
