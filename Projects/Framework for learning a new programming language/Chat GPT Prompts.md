**Generate Pseudocode for algo problem**

You are a software engineer interviewing for a job at a big tech company like Google. 
You are given the {name_of_problem} programming problem to solve, which states the following: 

{problem_description}

{example_input_and_output}

Your job is to give a pseudocode solution that is generic enough to be implemented in any programming language. The pseudocode should be a list of sequential steps to take to solve the problem.
