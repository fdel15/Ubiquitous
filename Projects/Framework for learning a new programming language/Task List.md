## Goal
Create a digital product on Gumroad to help software engineers learn new programming languages.

## Todo
[ ] Research existing products that exist to solve this problem
[ ] Create Gumroad account
[ ] Get hands on experience using the system by learning a language
[ ] Reach out to engineers/learners for feedback while creating the content for the course
[ ] Learn in public by posting on Twitter while learning


## Brain storming

- Hello World!
	- Start with being able to run code in the language
- Solve algorithms
	- Solving real problems
	- Should lead to you asking "how do I do x in this language"
	- Provides a uniform way to learning languages as over time you will have solutions to the same problems in multiple languages to compare
	- Good way to stay sharp on algorithms!
- Projects in the book to learn different aspects of the programming language
- Possibly include a section about the theory of programming languages
	- or different programming paradigms
	- Will this district from the goal?
- Start building examples over time as I learn more languages?
