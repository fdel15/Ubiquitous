Prompt: How do I set up my local environment to write programs in Ruby and execute them? Can you please required the minimum requirements a computer needs? Can you please provide instructions for different operating systems?

Sure, here are instructions for setting up a local environment for Ruby programming on different operating systems:

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Processor: 1GHz or faster
- RAM: 1GB (2GB recommended)
- Hard disk space: 100MB for Ruby installation, additional space for development tools and libraries

**For Windows:**
1. Download RubyInstaller from the Ruby website (https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and run the installer.
2. During installation, make sure to select the option to add Ruby to your PATH environment variable.
3. Once installation is complete, open a command prompt and run "ruby -v" to verify that Ruby is installed and working.

**For macOS:**
1. macOS comes with Ruby pre-installed, so no additional installation is necessary.
2. However, it is recommended to use a version manager like rbenv or rvm to manage multiple versions of Ruby on your system.
3. To install rbenv, run "brew install rbenv" in a terminal window. Then, add the following to your shell profile (.bashrc or .zshrc):
   ```
   eval "$(rbenv init -)"
   ```
4. Once rbenv is installed and configured, you can use it to install and switch between different versions of Ruby.

**For Linux:**
1. Depending on your Linux distribution, you may be able to install Ruby using your package manager (e.g. "apt-get install ruby" on Ubuntu).
2. Alternatively, you can download and install Ruby from the Ruby website.
3. Once Ruby is installed, you can use a version manager like rbenv or rvm to manage multiple versions of Ruby on your system.

In addition to installing Ruby itself, you may also want to install a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to make it easier to write and debug your Ruby code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and RubyMine.
