- Hello World!
	- Start with being able to run code in the language
	- Lets make this a multi step project
		- print "hello world"
		- take name as input
		- print "Hello {name}"
- Solve algorithms
	- Solving real problems
	- Should lead to you asking "how do I do x in this language"
	- Provides a uniform way to learning languages as over time you will have solutions to the same problems in multiple languages to compare
	- Good way to stay sharp on algorithms!
- Projects in the book to learn different aspects of the programming language
	- Things to cover in projects:
		- user input
		- handling dates
		- Mathematical precision (decimals, floats, round, random)
			- Currency?
- Possibly include a section about the theory of programming languages
	- or different programming paradigms
	- Will this district from the goal?
- Start building examples over time as I learn more languages?


Introduction
- Why it is important for programmers to learn multiple programming languages
- Discuss the challenges of learning a new programming language
- The importance and benefits of having a consistent approach to learning a new programming language
- Why having a framework to learn new programming languages will be a valuable tool in your developer tool kit
