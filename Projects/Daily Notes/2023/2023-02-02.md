I downloaded Obsidian today on my personal Mac.

I will be using it to organize and connect my notes as I research various topics that interest me.

Being able to connect ideas from different disciplines can lead to innovation and insights I might otherwise miss.

I am going to use the Daily Note feature to get back to journaling.

Recording my own thoughts over time has been beneficial when I have been disciplined enough to do it.

My main motivation for downloading the app today is to help me create a science fiction newsletter that includes technology that both sounds unrealisitc and likely to appear in the near future as technology grows exponentially.
