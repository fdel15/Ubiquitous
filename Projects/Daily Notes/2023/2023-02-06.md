I finally feel happy today after feeling lousy the last 3 days.

I don't know what has changed.

Maybe forced interaction since I returned to work?

Maybe I am finally over being annoyed about having the water to the refrigerator turned off?

Maybe it is because I have been doing a better job eating vegetables the last few days.

Either way, I am happy to be back. I need to remember this the next I am feeling in a funk. Whatever I am annoyed with will pass, and it is preventing me from enjoying life.

It reminds me of a Mark Twain quote

> I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened

My thought process made me unhappier than I needed to be.
