It's a Saturday. I woke up at around 5:30am on the couch. I am feeling anxiety about the Glide forking project at work, if I understand how it is going to work, if I am doing a good enough job communicating, and if I am going to get fired.

Realistically, it is a small probability I get fired, but I believe my worry comes from how much that would impact our lives right now.

I am opening up Obsidian because I want to read more from Physics Of The Future and take notes.

I need to move forward with my idea for creating a newsletter of short stories about the exponential technologies that will soon be impacting our lives.

I need to get into the habit of working on this every day.

If I work on it every day, the results will come.
