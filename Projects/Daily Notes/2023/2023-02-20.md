I feel very tired.

I did not get out of bed until after 8am, and I never felt fully energetic throughout the day.

I did get a lot done work wise, and the day seemed to fly by because of that.

But now it is 8pm, and I am still tired.

I am proud of myself for choosing to read [[Physics Of The Future]] instead of watch TV tonight.

As long as I keep making decisions like this, I will be very happy with future Frank.
