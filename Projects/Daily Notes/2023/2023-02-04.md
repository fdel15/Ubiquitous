Not a great start today.

After Brighton took his daily dosage of the peanut protein, Nathena casually said that she hopes it's ok to leave out because she has been leaving it on the dining room table.

Room temperature is probably ok I thought to myself, and think I said out loud, but we should not be storing medicine on the dining room table. This is one of the things that drives me crazy about Nathena. She always wants to dump everything on the dining room table and store it there indefinitely, which causes it to constantly be cluttered.

I suggested that we move the medicine to the kitchen. There is a shelf we could keep it on right above the coffee makers and have a Brighton peanut allergy section. This way we are organized because his stuff has a home, and it is very close to the current location of the dining room table.

She was annoyed by the suggestion. "Can we just keep it here for this week? It's already a lot for me."

"Sure." I said, and I left the room before I said anything else.

I feel extremely frustrated at that response. I reject the notion that moving where we store his stuff makes anything more stressful, and I am frustrated how even though the first week of the OIT program has been going extremely well for Brighton that she feels overwhelmed.
