I was exhausted today after needing to get up multiple times last night to help Brighton go to the bathroom. We have a sensor that sounds an alarm as soon as it detects wetness and Nathena and I are switching off every night to help wake up when the alarm goes off.

I didn't get much work done. Partly because I was tired and partly because my job is to talk to other people about the work that needs to get done and jump through a bunch of hoops before any work actually gets done.

My highlight was watching a Lex Friedman interview with [[Ray Kurzweil]] which was pretty interesting. I should have picked up a biography about him instead of [[BuckminsterÂ Fuller]]. I am going to read all of Ray's books this year.
