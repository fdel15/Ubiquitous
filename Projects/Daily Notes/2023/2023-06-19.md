I decided I need to write today because I have a lot of thoughts bouncing around in my head and I need to organize them so I can focus on producing something tangible.

## Goals

- Earn $2 million in the next 4 years
- Control of how I spend my time in 4 years
- Create long lasting positive impact

My primary goal is to make more money so that we can pay off our mortgage, put in a pool, and do other home improvement projects that will be costly. Overall, we want to earn 2 million dollars over the next 4 years.

A secondary goal is to be able to control my time. I want to work only on projects that I think are worth working on. I want to work because I like what I am doing and not because I need the money/benefits.

And the third goal, which may be achieved through the first two goals above, is to create something that adds value to society. I want to be able to look back in 50 years and be able to see my impact in the world.

## Project Ideas

With these goals in mind, I have a list of ideas running through my head at the moment.

- Write Learn Programming Languages book
- Create LLM app that translates Academic papers into content that is easier to digest
- Create an LLM that specializes in Twitter algorithm and can help you write tweets that are more likely to be displayed in the "FOR YOU" section
- Get promoted at Compass to Senior Engineer II
- Get promoted at Compass to Staff Software Engineer
- Gain a deeper understanding of Deep Learning by working through "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch" book
- Write a Distributed Algorithms book

	- If you are efficient during work hours this is more than enough time
- Exercise on days you do not do bedtime
	- Every other day between 7-8pm

		- Best time to do podcasts/audio books
- Saturdays/Sundays are the only days you should be watching TV
