- States that no two electrons can exist in the same quantum state
- When two nearly identical electrons get too close they repel each other
- This is the reason why objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion
- When we sit in a chair we think we are touching it. We are actually hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair's electrical and quantum forces
- If we could neutralize the Pauli Exclusion Principal we might be able to walk through walls
