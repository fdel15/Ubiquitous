- Chimps and Humans DNA only differs by 1.5%
	- Divergence happened about 6 million years ago
	- Chimps diverged from chickens about 300 million years ago
- [[ASPM gene]] is responsible for controlling brain size
	- has mutated 15 times since humans diverged from apes
	- coincides with human's increase in intelligence
	- fastest rate of change in this gene
- [[HAR1]] region of genome consists of 118 letters
	- crucial difference between apes and humans is only 18 letters (nucleic acids)
	- Chimps and chickens only diverge by 2 letters
	- Since it has been so stable for millions of years and now is much different between humans and apes, the key to being human may reside in this region
- 2009 [[Svante Paabo]] of [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] sequenced the genome of a Neanderthal
- [[FOXP2 gene]] helps humans to speak thousands of words
- [[HOX genes]] (the genes that describe the layout of the human body from head to toe) are mirrored in the order they appear in chromosomes
