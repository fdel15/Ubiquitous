The ability to grow body parts in a lab from your own cells

Steps to growing a new organ:
1. Extract a few cells from your body
2. Inject the cells into a plastic mold that looks like a sponge in the shape of the organ
	- the plastic mold is made from biodegradable polyglycolic acid
3. Treat the cells with certain growth factors to stimulate cell growth
4. Eventually the mold disintegrates and leaves behind a functional organ

- first windpipe was grown in 2009
