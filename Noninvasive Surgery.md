Mentioned in [[Physics Of The Future]] pg. 93

[[da Vinci robotic system]] is already used in 800 hospitals and has performed over 48,000 operations

future versions will be able to perform surgeries on microscopic blood vessels, nerve fibers, and tissues by manipulating microscopic tweezers, scalpels, and needles

Endoscopes (long tubes inserted into the body that can illuminate and cut tissue) will be thinner than thread

micromachines smaller than a period will be doing the mechanical work
