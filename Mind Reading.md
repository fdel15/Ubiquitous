### EEG

Using EEG monitors, people can control things with their minds

[[NeuroSky]] is a toy company that created a headband with an EEG type electrode inside that allows you to control the toy. For example, you can raise a Ping-Pong ball in a cylinder using your thoughts.

Pros of EEG:
- Can rapidly detect various frequencies emitted by the brain without elaborate expensive equipment

Cons of EEG:
- Cannot localize thoughts to specific areas of the brain

### fMRI
fMRI
- functional magnetic resonance imaging
- uses "echoes" created by radio waves to peer inside living tissue
- this makes it possible to create 3D images of inside the brain
- fMRI scan allows scientists to locate the presence of oxygen contained within hemoglobin in the blood
	- oxygenated hemoglobin delivers energy to cells
	- detecting the flow of hemoglobin oxygen allows scientists to trace the flows of thoughts in the brain
	- can detect the motion of thoughts in the living brain to a resolution of 0.1 millimeters
		- this corresponds to a few thousand neurons
	- eventually they may be as precise as single neurons which will allow scientists to trace neural patterns of specific thoughts

[[Joshua Freedman]] a psychiatrist from University of California, Los Angeles
> It's like being an astronomer in the 16th century after the invention of the telescope.

[[Kendrick Kay]] and colleagues at University of Berkeley created a software program that can associate objects people look at with fMRI patterns
> It may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone

Eventually, a computer will scan thousands of fMRI patterns from a thinking brain and decipher each one. This will allow scientists to decode a person's stream of consciousness.

### Recording Dreams

[[Advanced Telecommunications Research Computational Neuroscience Laboratory in Kyoto]] used fMRI scans to record where pinpoints of light are stored in the brain

Scientists created a 10 x 10 grid of these pinpoints

Images made by lights in these pinpoints were mapped in the brain, where scientists expected them

In the future, scientists will add more pixels to the 10 x 10 grid

Scientists claim that any thought or visual can be recorded using this process

This will make it possible to record dreams and mental images

### Ethics of mind reading

[[David Baltimore]] 
- predicts embarrassing but not disastrous results from mind reading
	- half of all students during any given college lecture are having erotic fantasies
- "Can we tap into the thoughts of others? ... I don't think that's pure science fiction but, it would create a hell of a world. Imagine courting a mate if your thoughts could be read. Or negotiating a contract if your thoughts could be read."

### Limitations on mind reading
- thoughts are not always crystal clear
	- may be hard to decipher what people are thinking
	- dreams may be very fuzzy even if interpreted
- it may only be possible to read people's minds from up close
- devices may be created to scramble and encode brain signals
