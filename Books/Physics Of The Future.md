Experiments performed by Michio Kaku:

-   Built an atom smasher (pg 2)
-   Built a cloud chamber to take pictures of antimatter (pg 2)

Defines “futurists” as outsiders who are predicting the world of science without a firsthand knowledge of the science itself

Jules Verne is credited with having predicted the future in his best selling novels such as 20,000 Leagues under the sea, around the world in 80 days, Journey to the center of the Earth, and Paris in the Twentieth Century.

************Quotes************

> Without the scientist, there is no future. (pg. 2)

> The key to understanding the future is to grasp the fundamental laws of nature and then apply them to the inventions, machines, and therapies that will redefine our civilization far into the future (pg. 3)

> The scientists, the insiders who are actually creating the future in their laboratories, are too busy making breakthroughs to have time to write books about the future for the public (pg. 3)

> How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself, he constantly sought out scientists, peppering them with questions about their vision of the future. He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. (pg. 5)

> Leonardo (da Vinci) was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality

## The Future Of Computers

-   Mark Weiser predicted computer chips would be so small and cheap they would be in clothes, walls, everywhere and connected to the internet before the personal computer had caught on (pg 21-22)
-   pg 23 has great examples of power of computer growing exponentially over past 50 years (e.g. cell phone more power than NASA in 1969)
-   the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has a long standing tradition to finance risky but visionary technologies
    -   Examples:
        -   Internet to connect scientists
        -   GPS to guide ICBM missels
    -   It is worth looking into what they are currently funding and they can be a character in stories for visionary technologies

> Today when we enter a room we automatically look for the light switch, since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room is to look for the Internet portal, because we will assume the room is intelligent. (pg. 25)

********************************************Near Future (by 2030)********************************************

-   Internet Glasses and Contact Lenses (pg. 27-30)
    -   ****************Vision:****************
        -   Glasses and contact lenses that connect people to the internet and dramatically change the way we connect to the internet
        -   Video in the lenses can share experiences directly on the internet
            -   No more selfies
        -   Goal: Create a contact lens with 3600 pixels, each one no more than 10 micrometers thick
    -   **********************Technology:**********************
        -   Since 1991 University of Washington have worked on Virtual Retinal Display (VRD)
        -   Babak A. Parviz at University of Washington are laying the ground work for internet contact lenses
        -   contact lenses will send super sharp image directly onto the retina
        -   the same technology used in the chip industry to carve out tiny transistors can also be used to etch tiny lasers of the same size making it possible to create lasers that are 100 atoms across
-   **Driverless Car** (pg. 31 - 34)
    -   **********Technology:**********
        -   32 GPS satellites orbiting the earth emit a specific radio wave which is picked up by GPS receivers in the car
        -   By analyzing the distortion of frequencies from 3-4 satellites computers can determine location
-   ************************************Four Wall Screens************************************ (pg. 34 - 35)
    -   **************Vision:**************
        -   Connect with people easier than ever and make telecommuting better by having a wall that connects people to the internet and makes them feel like they are in the same place
-   **************************************************Flexible Electronic Paper************************************************** (pg. 35 - 37)
    -   **************Vision:**************
        -   When putting up wall paper you may also put up these wall screens at the same time, making redecorating as simple as downloading a new design
        -   Instead of scribbling notes on paper we scribble notes on disposable computers that we can fold and carry around with us
        -   No need to lug around heavy laptops because the flexible screen technology will allow us to carry just a portable screen
    -   **********************Technology:**********************
        -   Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) based on an organic compound that can be arranged in a polymer to make them flexible
        -   Arizona State University’s Flexible Display Center is working with Hewlett Packard and the US Army to perfect this technology
-   ****************************Virtual Worlds**************************** (pg. 37 - 39)
    -   **************Vision:**************
        -   Put us into the world of the computer
        -   Ability to train surgeons
        -   Computer games that make you feel like you are there
        -   Ability to see virtual worlds and touch and interact with objects in the virtual worlds
    -   ********************Technology********************:
        -   haptic technology - ability to feel and touch objects in a virtual world
