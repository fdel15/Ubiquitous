>Just as your company’s technical quality bar will shift over time, your
approach to managing technical quality will evolve in tandem:
>1. fix the hot spots that are causing immediate problems
>2. adopt best practices that are known to improve quality
>3. prioritize leverage points that preserve quality as your software changes
>4. align technical vectors in how your organization changes software
>5. measure technical quality to guide deeper investment
>6. spin up a technical quality team to create systems and tools for
quality
>7. run a quality program to measure, track and create accountability

> You’re more likely to fix a quality hot spot, roll out a best practice, start running an architecture review, abolish that architecture review, and go back to hot‐spotting for a bit. **Premature processes add more friction than value** and are quick to expose themselves as ineffective. If something isn’t working, try for a bit to make it work, and then celebrate its demise.

> there are a small handful of places where extra investment preserves quality over time, both by preventing gross quality failures and reducing the cost of future quality investments. I call those quality leverage points, and the three most impactful points are interfaces, stateful systems, and data models

> One of the hidden powers of investing in leverage points is that you don’t need total organizational alignment to do it. To write a technical vision or roll out a best practice, you need that sort of buy‐in, which is why I recommend starting with leverage points. However, if you’ve exhausted the accessible impact from leverage points, it may be time to move on to driving broader organizational alignment
