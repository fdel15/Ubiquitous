> A good design document describes a specific problem, surveys possible solutions, and explains the selected approach’s details (pg. 44)

> A few rules useful for determining if a project requires a design document:
> 1. any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects
> 2. projects that meaningfully impact users
> 3. any work taking more than a month of engineering time

> It takes a lot of practice to write great design documents.
