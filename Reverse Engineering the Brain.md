[[Fred Hapgood]], MIT researcher says:
> Discovering how the brain works-- exactly how it works, the way we know how a motor works--would rewrite almost every text in the library

- [[Blue Gene]] is a super computer built by [[IBM]] in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California
	- Capable of computing 500 trillion operations a second
	- can simulate the brain of a mouse for a few seconds
 
- [[Blue Brain Project]] of [[Henry Markram]] of [[Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne]] in Switzerland is focused on simulating the brain of a mouse
	- 2006 was successfully modeling the rat's neocortical column
	- proved it was biologically possible to completely analyze the structure of an important element of the brain neuron for neuron
	- Markram predicted in 2009 that it would not be impossible to build a human brain within 10 years that could speak and have intelligence
	- It would take a supercomputer 20,000 times more powerful than anything that existed in 2009 and require memory storage 500 times the size of the 2009 internet

- [[Dharmendra Modha]] lead a group using [[Dawn]], the most advanced version of [[Blue Gene]] created at the time
	- 2006 it could simulate 40% of a mouse's brain
	- 2007 it could simulate 100% of a rat's brain
		- 55 million neurons
	- 2009 it could simulate 1% of a human cerebral cortex
		- 1.6 billion neurons
		- 9 trillion connections
	- Problem with energy usage
		- would require 1 billion watts (entire output of a nuclear power plant) to scale to 100% of human brain
		- by contrast, the human brain uses 20 watts
