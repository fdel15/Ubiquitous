Mentioned in [[Physics Of The Future]] pg. 136

Tithonous was a mortal who fell in love with [[Eos]]. [[Eos]] was the god of the dawn.

Eos asked her father [[Zeus]] to grant Tithonous eternal life, so they could be together forever. 

However, she forgot to ask for eternal youth as well and as a result Tithonous continued to age and wither away in excruciating agony without being able to die.

Life extension without health and vigor can be an eternal punishment.
