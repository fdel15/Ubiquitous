- Has driven down the costs of genetic sequencing from $50,000 to $1,000.
- Key innovation was to take a shortcut by taking advantage of the fact that most people differ on average by less than 0.1% in their DNA. He breaks up the human genome into units of DNA containing 32 bits of information. He uses a computer to compare the 32 bits to the completed genomes of other people.
