The goal is to use hashtags as another way to link material in similar categories. I will keep a list here of hashtags that I can reference when trying to decide how to add them to new content

**ai**
  Note is using or talks about Artificial Intelligence

**consumer_product** 
  This hashtag was created when reading about future technologies. It means that scientists are already implementing the technology in products that people can try

**daily_note**
  Daily journal/note entry in Obsidian

**neuro_science**
  This hashtag was created when reading about future technologies. It means that the technology is related to the mind, like Neuralink

**nobel_laureate**
  A person who has won a Nobel Prize. There should be an additional hashtag for the discipline they won the prize.

**robotics**
